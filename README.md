>[!CAUTION]
> Aliencrypt performs various operations on files, many of which can result in files being unrecoverable and / or destroyed, and can even render your system compromised. It is highly advisable that you ALWAYS use root permissions and ALWAYS check if you are using the correct file path.

# Installation

To install and run the program, run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bombenheimer/Aliencrypt.git
cd Aliencrypt
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
sudo python3 Aliencrypt.py
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Once installed, Aliencrypt MUST be ran using root permissions. If you do not use ```sudo```, Aliencrypt will refuse to run. This is an example of what will happen when you don't use ```sudo```:

# Demonstration
> [!TIP]
> It is recommended to check if you are using the correct path you are testing with either option 1 or 2, and then use option 0.

## Encrypt Files (Option 0)
üîê When this option is chosen, it will encrypt[^1] all files in the directory you have chosen and ask if you would like to create a decryption key to decrypt the files at a later time. This option also encrypts the names of the files as well (v2.0.0 and up), for extra security. The generated keys have a unique name as well, so you can keep track of each one that you use.
