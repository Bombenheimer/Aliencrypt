>[!CAUTION]
> Aliencrypt performs various operations on files, many of which can result in files being unrecoverable and / or destroyed, and can even render your system compromised. It is highly advisable that you ALWAYS use root permissions and ALWAYS check if you are using the correct file path.

# Installation

## 1: Install python3
To check if ```python3``` is installed, run:
```bash
python3 --version
```

If ```python3``` is not installed, you must [install](https://www.python.org) it first for your system.

## 2: Install pip
If ```python3``` is installed run:
```bash
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
python3 get-pip.py
```

This will install the ```pip``` package manager. However, if this does not work, you can install pip via your package manager:

| Operating System | Package Manager | Command |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Debian GNU/Linux | Apt | ```sudo apt install python3-pip``` |
| Fedora GNU/Linux | Dnf | ```sudo dnf install python3-pip``` |
| Arch GNU/Linux | Pacman | ```sudo pacman -S python-pip``` |
| CentOS/RHEL | Yum | ```sudo yum install python3-pip``` |
| macOS | Homebrew or MacPorts | ```brew install python3``` or ```sudo port install py-pip``` |

To check if pip installation was successful, run:
```
pip --version
```

## 2: Clone Repo and run
To install and run the program, run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bombenheimer/Aliencrypt.git
cd Aliencrypt
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
sudo python3 Aliencrypt.py
```

## 3 (Optional) Create Executable

### Using Nuitka
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Nuitka does not currently work with Python 3.12, only 3.11 and lower.

At this point in the installation process, you can run Aliencrypt by executing the program directly. But if you want to turn the program into an executable binary later, you can use Nuitka by running:
```bash
nuitka3 --output-filename=Aliencrypt Aliencrypt.py
sudo mv Aliencrypt /usr/local/bin
sudo Aliencrypt
```

This will use Nuitka to turn the program into an executable and move it to your local software binary directory. It is recommended to use Nuitka as it will make the compliled result much faster by turn the source code into C and the compile it.

### Using Pyinstaller
If you decide to use Pyinstaller, you can run:
```
pyinstaller --onefile --clean --noconfirm --log-level=ERROR Aliencrypt.py
sudo mv dist/Aliencrypt /usr/local/bin
rm -rf build/ dist/
sudo Aliencrypt
```

This will use Pyinstaller to turn the script into an executable and move it to your local software binary and delete uncessesary generated directories.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Once installed, Aliencrypt MUST be ran using root permissions. If you do not use ```sudo```, Aliencrypt will refuse to run. This is an example of what will happen when you don't use ```sudo```:

# Demonstration
> [!TIP]
> It is recommended to check if you are using the correct path you are testing with either option 1 or 2, and then use option 0.

## Encrypt Files (Option 0)
üîê When this option is chosen, it will encrypt[^1] all files in the directory you have chosen and ask if you would like to create a decryption key to decrypt the files at a later time. This option also encrypts the names of the files as well (v2.0.0 and up), for extra security. The generated keys have a unique name as well, so you can keep track of each one that you use.

## Show Files (Option 1)
üìÇ When this option is chosen, it will show all files in the directory you have chosen as well as hidden ones.

## File Information (Option 2)
‚ÑπÔ∏è When this option is chosen, it will show how many of each type of file is inside the directory you have chosen based on the file extention.

## Change Colors (Option 3)
üåà When this option is chosen, it will ask you what color scheme you would like to pick and it will restart the program to it change to those colors.
